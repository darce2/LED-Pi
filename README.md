# LED-Pi
Using Lightshowpi and Bibliopixel, work on LEDs syncing to music using synchronized_lights.py

A raspberry pi B+ is used to control the lights and an LED strip from adafruit the LPD8806 http://www.adafruit.com/product/306


This is using the work of Lightshowpi at http://lightshowpi.org/ as well Bibliopixel https://github.com/maniacallabs/bibliopixel/

This tries to modify the synchronized_lights.py file with a function to sync lights to the music with intensity of the soung = bightness level. A seperate function can be writen to cycle colors while running.

This seeks to only use the audio in mode from lightshow pi in synchronized_lights.py and using the ledStrip class with apropiate drivers.
